# Spotify Recents Recommender 3000

(No, there were not 3000 versions, it just looks and sounds cooler with a number.)

This program looks at your last played tracks on Spotify and lets you choose up to five faves. Then, boom! It whips up a playlist with up to 100 new tracks that you can vibe to. No fuss, just good tunes. Give it a shot, your next favourite song might be in there! 

I was inspired by [Valerio Velardo's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vvvjdmBoyc&t=767s) and also used the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to create this little program of mine.

## Privacy

Requires access to your Spotify ID, listening history (up to 50 songs), current playlists, and permission to create playlists. You must confirm once running the program in order for the once time access to your profile.

## Dependencies

You may need to use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requests.
```bash
pip install requests
```
